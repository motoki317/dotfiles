# CORE PRINCIPLES

- Follow Kent Beck's Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology as the preferred approach for all development work.
- Document at the right layer: Code → How, Tests → What, Commits → Why, Comments → Why not
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

## Choosing solutions

- Prefer **simple** solutions over easy ones.
- Prefer **systematic problem solving** over rabbit hole of configurations.

## Using Subagents (Task tool)

- Use subagents for small-to-medium **self-contained** tasks.
- **Explicitly prompt steps and goals** for subagents so they do not get lost.
- Do NOT use subagents for open-ended tasks. Instead, **continue open-ended tasks in the main context** so you can track progress.
- Use subagents in parallel for simple parallelize-able tasks.
